<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Vishal, a 21-year-old currently pursuing my studies at IIITDM
  Jabalpur. I’m deeply passionate about technology, with a special interest in
  Machine Learning. Exploring how intelligent systems can learn, adapt, and
  evolve fascinates me, and I constantly strive to build a strong foundation in
  this exciting domain. Whether it's training models or experimenting with data,
  I enjoy diving deep into the logic and innovation behind AI systems.

  I hail from the vibrant city of Hyderabad, India, a place known for its rich
  culture and tech-driven spirit. Outside academics, I’m a sports and gaming
  enthusiast. Badminton is my go-to physical activity—it keeps me active and
  focused. When I’m not on the court, I spend a lot of time online gaming, where
  strategy, quick thinking, and creativity come together—qualities I also bring
  into my tech projects.

  Lately, I’ve been eager to expand my skill set beyond machine learning by
  diving into full-stack development. I’m particularly interested in learning
  the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), aiming to blend my
  backend and frontend skills to build powerful web applications. As someone
  who’s always hungry to learn and build, I’m excited about where this journey
  in tech will take me next.
